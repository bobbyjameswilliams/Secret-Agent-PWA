There are two servers for this application: Main Server and MongoDB Server.
Run both servers to use the application.
Main Server runs on localhost port 3000, and MongoDB Server runs on localhost port 3001. 
To be safe, you might want to run npm install on '<MainDirectory>/solution/Main Server' and '<MainDirectory>/solution/MongoDB Server'.
